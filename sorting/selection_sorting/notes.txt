Analogy with Books:
- Imagine you have a shelf filled with books of different heights, and you want to arrange them from shortest to tallest using selection sort:

- Starting at the Beginning:
    You start at one end of the shelf (the beginning of the array).

- Finding the Shortest Book:
    You look through all the books from your current position to the end of the shelf (array) to find the shortest book.

- Placing in Order:
    Once you find the shortest book, you swap it with the book at your current position on the shelf.
    Now, the shortest book is in its correct sorted position at the start of the shelf.

- Moving Forward:
    Move to the next position on the shelf (array) and repeat the process: find the shortest book in the remaining unsorted books and swap it with the book at your current position.

- Repeat Until Sorted:
    Continue this process until you have gone through all the books on the shelf (array).
    By the end, all the books (elements) are sorted from shortest to tallest.


Example:
Let's sort the array [64, 25, 12, 22, 11] using selection sort, following the analogy:

Initial Array: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]

- First Pass:
    Find the smallest element in the array (11).
    Swap it with the first element (64).
    Array becomes: [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]

- Second Pass:
    Find the smallest element in the remaining array (12).
    Swap it with the second element (25).
    Array becomes: [11, 12, 25, 22, 64]

- Third Pass:
    Find the smallest element in the remaining array (22).
    Swap it with the third element (25).
    Array becomes: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

- Fourth Pass:
    Find the smallest element in the remaining array (25).
    Swap it with the fourth element (25) (no actual swap needed).
    Array remains: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

- Fifth Pass:
    Find the smallest element in the remaining array (64).
    Swap it with the fifth element (64) (no actual swap needed).
    Array remains: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
